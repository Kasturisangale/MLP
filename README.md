System Threat Forecaster-

Description:
This Kaggle competition involves applying machine learning techniques to predict the probability of a system being infected by various families of malware, based on different system properties. The dataset consists of telemetry data, including system properties and corresponding infection labels, collected from threat reports generated by the systemâ€™s antivirus software.

The task is a classification problem, where machine learning models are used to classify systems as either infected or non-infected, based on these telemetry features.
